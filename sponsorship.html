  Manufacturing and testing consume the majority of our budget, which is often our primary constraint.
  <i><strong>We are always actively pursuing new sponsors in the following areas:</strong></i>
</h3>
<br>
<p class="indent">
  <strong><u>Monetary:</u></strong><br>
  Monetary sponsorships are the most valuable. Monetary support gives us the most flexibility to allocate our resources with maximal efficiency.
  <br><br>
  <strong><u>Discounts/Services:</u></strong><br>
  Discounts and services allow us to operate within our tight budget and strict timelines. Past services provided include waterjet cutting, CNC machining, and laser cutting.
  <br><br>
  <strong><u>Material:</u></strong><br>
  Material sponsorships often are the easiest for companies to provide. Material that is often considered “scrap” in a commercial manufacturing operation can still be suitable for our purposes. Material donations free up our budget available for components which we cannot manufacture in-house.

  <strong>Benefits of sponsoring:</strong>
</h2>
<p class="indent">
	<strong><u>Tax Write-Offs:</u></strong><br>
	Support for WWU Racing is handled through the Western Washington University Foundation, which has nonprofit status. All contributions to the team are <strong>tax deductible</strong>.
  <br><br>
	<strong><u>Advertising:</u></strong><br>
	Sponsors receive logo placement on the car itself, team apparel, our website and social media. Throughout the year, we display the car at many events, both on campus and in public. Our competition videos showcasing the car receive over 10,000 views annually.
