We compete in the Formula SAE West competition with a new car every summer.
The competition involves both business and engineering events that put our work to the test, furthering our experience for the next car as well as life after graduation. The car's performance is tested through Acceleration, Skid Pad, Autocross, Endurance, and Efficiency events. The static events (Design, Cost, and Business Presentation) judge the process behind the physical design of the car, theoretical production cost, and a marketing and distribution plan for a consumer version of the car.
