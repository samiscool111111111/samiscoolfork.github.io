  Manufacturing and testing consume the majority of our budget, which is often our primary constraint.
  <i><strong>We are always actively pursuing new sponsors in the following areas:</strong></i>
</h3>
<br>
<p class="indent">
  <strong><u>Monetary:</u></strong><br>
  Monetary sponsorships are the most valuable. Monetary support gives us the most flexibility to allocate our resources with maximum efficiency.
  <br><br>
  <strong><u>Discounts/Services:</u></strong><br>
  Discounts and services allow us to operate within our tight budget and strict timelines. Past services provided include waterjet cutting, CNC machining, and laser cutting.
  <br><br>
  <strong><u>Material:</u></strong><br>
  Material sponsorships often are the easiest for companies to provide. Material that is often considered “scrap” in a commercial manufacturing operation can still be suitable for our purposes. Material donations free up our available budget for components which we cannot manufacture in-house.
