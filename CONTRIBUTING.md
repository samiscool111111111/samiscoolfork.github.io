# Contributing

**First:** if you're unsure or afraid of *anything*, just ask or submit the issue or pull request anyways. You won't be yelled at for giving your best effort. The worst that can happen is that you'll be politely asked to change something. We appreciate any sort of contributions, and don't want a wall of rules to get in the way of that.

Here are the basic steps to submit a pull request. Make sure that you're working
on an [open issue]–if the relevant issue doesn't exist, open it!

[open issue]: https://github.com/rhedgehog/WWURacing-web/issues

1. Claim an issue on [our issue tracker][open issue] by assigning it to yourself. If the issue doesn't exist yet, open it.

2. Create a branch off of [`development`](https://github.com/rhedgehog/WWURacing-web/tree/development) with a brief description and the issue number in the branch name (ex. `26-update-meeting-time`).

3. Make your changes.

4. Run `jekyll serve` to test your changes locally. Test on as many browsers/platforms/devices you reasonably have available.

5. Push your branch and submit a pull request. Include the issue number
   (ex. `Resolves #1`) in the PR description, as well as a brief description of what browsers/platforms/devices you tested on.

6. Once the PR has been approved, the branch will be merged and the PR will be closed automatically.

At this point you're waiting on us–we'll try to respond to your PR quickly.
We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Update the documentation, examples elsewhere, guides,
  whatever is affected by your contribution.
